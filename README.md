# ECG-Heartbeat-PROJECT
This project builds an automated, data-driven system to distinguish normal from abnormal heartbeats. Evaluating a full spectrum of approaches — from classical machine learning to advanced deep learning — with the practical objective of maximizing clinical safety (minimizing missed dangerous beats) while keeping strong overall performance.
